h1. Overview:

Misty is an asynchronous and multiprocessing IRC Bot that aims to be:
* Easily extendable with user based modules called Isles.
* Powerful message distribution resembling Django's URL dispatcher aka Lighthouse.
* Quick, Friendly, and as non IRC Botty as possible.

Misty was inspired by "Phenny":http://inamidst.com/phenny/,
and "DjangoBot":https://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/DjangoBot.

h1. Coming Soon:

* Searching via Django.
* Join multiple channels.
* More Core Isles.

h1. Requirements:

* "Twisted":http://twistedmatrix.com/
* "PostgreSQL":http://www.postgresql.org/
* "pyPgSQL":http://pypgsql.sourceforge.net/
* Misty has only been tested on OSX 10.6 and python 2.6

h1. Installation:

# Clone repo in desired directory.
# Duplicate and rename Misty/settings.py to settings_local.py
# Change Misty/settings_local.py to match your database & IRC server.
# Type @python Misty/misty_core.py@ in cmd line to start Misty.

h1. Extending:

# Make a IsleName.py in the directory you set with PATH_TO_ISLES in Misty/settings.py
# Make sure the IsleName.py has execute permission.
# Make sure IsleName.py has @#!/usr/bin/env python@
# Edit Misty/lighthouse.py to include your new Isle.
# If Misty is running, reload the list of Isles with @{nickname}:reload@ in IRC
